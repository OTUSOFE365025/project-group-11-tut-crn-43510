# Business Case

## Problem

Universities use multiple disconnected systems for courses, grades, and events. Students and staff would spend time navigating and accessing many different platforms. Negatively impacting student engagement, lecturer efficiency, and institutional responsiveness.

## Solution

AIDAP unifies access through an AI-powered assistant that integrates all systems into a single, intuitive interface, enabling seamless communication with users. Providing real-time updates of data through all connected systems, and a centralized interface where you can use all the other systems.

## Benefits

Students will have an easier time accessing deadlines, grades, and schedules, and receiving reminders, which will increase student satisfaction and engagement. The new system will simplify the process of making announcements, changing course information, and provide timely updates, improving lecturer productivity. Administrators will have central control and monitor security, resulting in a significant reduction in repetitive administrative queries, allowing them to focus on more important tasks. The central data for the system will make monitoring performance easier for the system maintainers.

## Risks

Some issues that we risk arising are data privacy concerns, as we are centralizing many different systems, which means there are more opportunities for data leakage. We also risk system downtime during implementation and when updating or changing existing systems; however, the downtime risk is mitigated by our use of failovers. There will also be user adoption challenges when we first implement the system, but we can provide onboarding sessions and training videos to help users adapt to the change.
